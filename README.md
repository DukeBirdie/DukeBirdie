- 👋 Hi, I’m @DukeBirdie
- 👀 I’m interested in some coding stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C, nmap, and some ethical hacking stuff to go with it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++ projects (keep in mind I'm not good).
- I've been learning python and I'm currently far better at using python than C or C++.
- 📫 How to reach me... email: littlebirdiethe2nd@gmail.com.
